# ContactsPhoneNumbers [![Flattr this git repo](http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=dbaq&url=https://github.com/dbaq/cordova-plugin-contacts-phone-numbers&title=cordova-plugin-contacts-phone-numbers&language=en&tags=github&category=software)

Cross-platform plugin for Cordova / PhoneGap to list all the contacts with at least a phone number.

## Add Contact ##
Use the  `navigator.contactsPhoneNumbers` with the method

  `add(data)`

  A full example could be:

```
   //
   //
   // after deviceready
   //
   //
   var name = "Call Pal";
   var firstNumber = {
     label: 'mobile',
     number: $scope.number
   };
   var secondNumber = {
     label: 'mobile',
     number: '17864500211'
   };
   var data = {
     name: name,
     phones: [firstNumber, secondNumber]
   };
   navigator.contactsPhoneNumbers.add(data);

```

## Installing the plugin ##

Use this repository
```
cordova plugin add https://github.com/CallPal/cordova-plugin-contacts-phone-numbers
```
## Using the plugin ##
The plugin creates the object `navigator.contactsPhoneNumbers` with the methods

  `list(success, fail)`

A full example could be:

```
   //
   //
   // after deviceready
   //
   //
   navigator.contactsPhoneNumbers.list(function(contacts) {
      console.log(contacts.length + ' contacts found');
      for(var i = 0; i < contacts.length; i++) {
         console.log(contacts[i].id + " - " + contacts[i].displayName);
         for(var j = 0; j < contacts[i].phoneNumbers.length; j++) {
            var phone = contacts[i].phoneNumbers[j];
            console.log("===> " + phone.type + "  " + phone.number + " (" + phone.normalizedNumber+ ")");
         }
      }
   }, function(error) {
      console.error(error);
   });

```

## JSON Response format

The success callback function contains an array of contacts.

Each entry contains:

   * the unique contact id
   * the name of the contact (first name, last name, display name)
   * an array containing the number, the normalizedNumber and the type of the number (```WORK```, ```MOBILE```, ```HOME``` or ```OTHER```)

Here is a sample of what you can get:

```
    [{
        "id": "1",
        "firstName": "Kate",
        "lastName": "Bell",
        "displayName": "Kate Bell",
        "phoneNumbers": [{
            "number": "(555) 564-8583",
            "normalizedNumber": "(555) 564-8583",
            "type": "MOBILE"
        }, {
            "number": "(415) 555-3695",
            "normalizedNumber": "(415) 555-3695",
            "type": "OTHER"
        }]
    }, {
        "id": "2",
        "firstName": "Daniel",
        "lastName": "Higgins",
        "displayName": "Daniel Higgins",
        "phoneNumbers": [{
            "number": "555-478-7672",
            "normalizedNumber": "555-478-7672",
            "type": "HOME"
        }, {
            "number": "(408) 555-5270",
            "normalizedNumber": "(408) 555-5270",
            "type": "MOBILE"
        }, {
            "number": "(408) 555-3514",
            "normalizedNumber": "(408) 555-3514",
            "type": "OTHER"
        }]
    }, {
        "id": "3",
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Appleseed",
        "displayName": "John Appleseed",
        "phoneNumbers": [{
            "number": "888-555-5512",
            "normalizedNumber": "888-555-5512",
            "type": "MOBILE"
        }, {
            "number": "888-555-1212",
            "normalizedNumber": "888-555-1212",
            "type": "HOME"
        }]
    }]
```

## Behaviour

The plugin retrieves **ONLY** the contacts containing one or more phone numbers. It does not allow to modify them (use [the official cordova contacts plugin for that](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-contacts)).

With the official plugin, it is difficult and inefficient[1] to retrieve the list of all the contacts with at least a phone number (for Android at least). I needed a fastest way to retrieve a simple list containing just the name and the list of phone numbers.

If you need more fields like the email address or if you also need to retrieve the contacts without email address, we can add an option, open an issue and I'll see what I can do.

**[1]** When I say *difficult and inefficient*, it is because on Android, all your Gmail contacts are returned as a contact. [See this issue on stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20406564/phonegap-contacts-api-android-return-only-phone-contacts-and-not-gmail-conta). With the official plugin you have to retrieve all the contacts and then iterate over the result to filter out what you want.

I executed a small benchmark on my Nexus 5 with Lollipop. The code calls both plugins and displays the result in the console. On this phone I have 1028 contacts but only 71 contacts have at least a phone number. Of course the performances depends on the number of contacts with phone numbers.

## iOS and Android

The plugin works with iOS and Android.

iOS does not provide a normalized number like Android. So number === normalizedNumber for iOS.

The Android code is heavily inspired from the official plugin with some tweaks to improve the perfomances.

### Finding something to do

Ask, or pick an issue and comment on it announcing your desire to work on it. Ideally wait until we assign it to you to minimize work duplication.

### Reporting an issue

- Search existing issues before raising a new one.

- Include as much detail as possible.

### Pull requests

- Make it clear in the issue tracker what you are working on, so that someone else doesn't duplicate the work.
